<h3>Interests</h3>
    <p>I've always considered myself a lifelong learner, so
        over the past few years I have picked up the hobbies
        coding and woodworking. I have gained a particular interest
        in a particular type of woodworking called 'woodturning'. Simply put,
        woodturning is where you take a chunk of wood and spin it
        very fast and use special tools to shape it into something like
        a bowl, candlestick, or platter dish among many other things. 
        Coding has since become something I am passionate about,
        resulting in a full-time dedication to it. Aside from those two
        hobbies, I like to stay active with things like hockey, golf,
        hiking, and playing with my dog, roger!
