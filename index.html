        <h4>Burlington Code Academy</h4>

            <p id="careerp">After four years at Interstate Batteries my love for learning took over and 
                I approached my manager about running the comapanies digital marketing on my 
                own time. After becoming Google Adwords certified and learning more about the 
                digital world I became fascinated with what goes on behind all these great 
                websites and applications. While handling the digital marketing for Interstate 
                Batteries, I began to learn to code on my own, which led to the discovery of
                Burlington Code Academy. Burlington Code Academy has been an incredible learning
                experience, becoming a full stack developer has been the challenge I have been 
                looking for.

        <h3>Marketing Director</h3>
        <h4>Interstate Batteries</h4>
        
            <p id="careerp" id="midcareerp">After graduating from Champlain College I went right into the workforce
                with a marketing director position at Interstate Batteries. Interstate
                Batteries is a nationally recognized and marketed brand, with local branch
                ownership. I was in the Williston, Vermont branch, and with local
                ownership came a close relationship with manager and owner, and the
                freedom to curate my own marketing plan. This taught me about self-motivation, 
                how to direct myself and a little about my marketing values.

        <h3>Sales Manager</h3>
        <h4>Interstate Batteries</h4>
        
            <p id="careerp">After a year as the marketing director at Interstate Batteries, a sales
                position within the company opened up and I was offered the position.
                This was absolutely a step in the right direction for me, I had a love
                for economics in college and I did really enjoy the part of my workday
                where I was communicating with people. I had great success in the sales
                position at Interstate Batteries, growing my particular territory and 
                creating strong, lasting, loyal relationships with dozens of clients. Being 
                in sales taught me alot about myself, I figured out I can be a great
                people person, I have a great sense for recognizing social situations, 
                and being able to effectively communicate with many different personalities.

        <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p>I've always considered myself a lifelong learner, so
                over the past few years I have picked up the hobbies
                coding and woodworking. I have gained a particular interest
                in a particular type of woodworking called 'woodturning'. Simply put,
                woodturning is where you take a chunk of wood and spin it
                very fast and use special tools to shape it into something like
                a bowl, candlestick, or platter dish among many other things. 
                Coding has since become something I am passionate about,
                resulting in a full-time dedication to it. Aside from those two
                hobbies, I like to stay active with things like hockey, golf,
                hiking, and playing with my dog, roger!
