            <p id="projectp">Yelpington is a website that mimmicks the popular app/website Yelp! But this one is just for Burlington, Vermont. My classmates and I chose restaurants we liked in Burlington, we first created a basic markup file with information about the restaurant and pushed it to our shared yelpington repository on Github. After that we translated all of the files into JSon form, so we could make our own websites that fetch the data from each restaurant and displays it depending which restaurant is searched or clicked on from the list.</p>

            <p id="projectp">In the GeoVermonter app we gathered the langitude and longitude points of the border of Vermont, and displayed that over the top of a map from openstreetmaps using a popular JS library called Leaflet. When you select start you are randomly placed within the borders of Vermont, you then are allowed to move the map North, East, South and West or guess the county you are in, subtracting 1 point starting at 20 for each action. The zooming capabilities are disabled during the game. If you give up it will display your longitude, latitude and county.</p>

            <p id="projectp">The Pomodoro Technique is a useful way to focus on a problem for a little while... but not too long that encourages regular breaks and can change your perception of time itself. So I created this webpage with a 25:00 minute timer that you can add and subtract minutes and seconds as you prefer. Once you have your preferred time, you start it, forget about it and it will play a ping noise when the time is up.</p>

            <p id="careerp">After four years at Interstate Batteries my love for learning took over and 
                I approached my manager about running the companies digital marketing on my 
                own time. After becoming Google Adwords certified and learning more about the 
                digital world I became fascinated with what goes on behind all these great 
                websites and applications. While handling the digital marketing for Interstate 
                Batteries, I began to learn to code on my own, which led to the discovery of
                Burlington Code Academy. Burlington Code Academy has been an incredible learning
                experience, and becoming a full stack developer has been the challenge I have been 
                looking for. I look forward to continue learning and developing personally and professionally
                after Burlington Code Academy.

    </div>  
            <p id="careerp" id="midcareerp">After graduating from Champlain College I went right into the workforce
                with a marketing director position at Interstate Batteries. Interstate
                Batteries is a nationally recognized and marketed brand, with local branch
                ownership. I was in the Williston, Vermont branch, and with local
                ownership came a close relationship with manager and owner, and the
                freedom to curate my own marketing plan. This taught me about self-motivation, 
                how to direct myself and a little about my marketing values and strategies.

                This was absolutely a step in the right direction for me, I had a love
                for economics in college and I did really enjoy the part of my workday
                where I was communicating with people. I had great success in the sales
                position at Interstate Batteries, growing my particular territory and

        <h3>Interests</h3>
            <p id="interestsp">I've always considered myself a lifelong learner, so
                over the past few years I have picked up the hobbies of
                coding and woodworking. I have gained a particular interest
                in a particular type of woodworking called 'woodturning'. Simply put,
                woodturning is where you take a chunk of wood and spin it
                very fast and use special tools to shape it into something like
                a bowl, candle holder, or platter dish among many other things. 
                Coding has since become something I am passionate about,
                resulting in a full-time dedication to it. Aside from those two
                hobbies, I like to stay active with things like hockey, golf and hiking 
                with my girlfriend Sammy and dog Roger!
