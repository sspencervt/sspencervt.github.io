<h3>Marketing Director</h3>
    <h4>Interstate Batteries</h4>

    <p>After graduating from Champlain College I went right into the workforce
        with a marketing director position at Interstate Batteries. Interstate
        Batteries is a nationally recognized and marketed brand, with local branch
        ownership. I was in the Williston, Vermont branch, and with local
        ownership came a close relationship with manager and owner, and the
        freedom to curate my own marketing plan. This taught me about self-motivation, 
        how to direct myself and a little about my marketing values.

<h3>Sales Manager</h3>
    <h4>Interstate Batteries</h4>

    <p>After a year as the marketing director at Interstate Batteries, a sales
        position within the company opened up and I was offered the position.
        This was absolutely a step in the right direction for me, I had a love
        for economics in college and I did really enjoy the part of my workday
        where I was communicating with people. I had great success in the sales
        position at Interstate Batteries, growing my particular territory and 
        creating strong, lasting, loyal relationships with dozens of clients. Being 
        in sales taught me alot about myself, I figured out I can be a great
        people person, I have a great sense for recognizing social situations, 
        and being able to effectively communicate with many different personalities.

<h3>Student</h3>
    <h4>Burlington Code Academy</h4>
    <p>After four years at Interstate Batteries my love for learning took over and 
        I approached my manager about running the comapanies digital marketing on my 
        own time. After becoming Google Adwords certified and learning more about the 
        digital world I became fascinated with what goes on behind all these great 
        websites and applications. While handling the digital marketing for Interstate 
        Batteries, I began to learn to code on my own, which led to the discovery of
        Burlington Code Academy. Burlington Code Academy has been an incredible learning
        experience, becoming a full stack developer has been the challenge I have been 
        looking for.
